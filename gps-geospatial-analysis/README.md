# GPS Geospatial Analysis

**Objective:** Clean GPS points, create route visualizations, and compare segment speeds.

**Files**
- `gps_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook (runnable)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- sample data: `../assets/data/gps_sample.csv`

**How to run**
1. Install requirements and open Jupyter:
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab


2. Open `gps_analysis.ipynb`.

**Key insights (example)**
- Average speed per segment, stop detection, and route heatmap.
